Okay—so I just got out of Until Dawn or was it Into the Dark? Whatever, anyway, the theater was 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦zing! Feel like I sat on a glacier and popcorn crumbs are everywhere like ants at a picnic. 

The  —wow, a mess. Or maybe I’m the mess? Loud, too loud, like a thunderstorm in my brainbrrrrr and I'm still hearing echoes from that big explosion scene. Crazy. Oh, remember to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , someone whispered that behind me. Must've been a ghost. Freaky shadows lurking and jumping and whispering sweet nothings or evil somethings.

> Gotta say, holding breath through half of it, pretty much like when waiting for a jury to come back with a verdict. Heart pounding, pulse racing. Why did I even sit at the weird angle? My back is now—like knots of old shoelaces! Anyway, some parts reminded me of my first court case. Everyone screaming, and nobody making sense. 

The noise! Like when my dishwasher goes off without being turned on. And oh, the moment she opened that door, bam! I spilled my whole bag of Skittles, all raining down like candy confetti—unbelievable. How they just swooped in and took everything, that one villain looking like he stepped out of one those outdated law textbooks we laughed at back in law school.

What was up with that scene by the lake? The water so calm while everyone’s losing their minds and it felt like like Emily Dickinson poetry meets action   mania. Could barely keep track of all those double twists. Should I 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again maybe? Perhaps. 

Someone left their weird orange jacket on the chair next to me. Like, what is this, Halloween or an airport terminal? Speaking of airports, that ending was a crash landing I won’t forget. Was I ever that dazed? Could barely figure out who was alive or...not. The lights flicked back on too soon or I blinked too slow.

def random_code_snippet():
    if   == confusing:
        popcorn.spill()
    return back_ache
   
Anyway, yeah, catch the   if you can, 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 or whatever. Now I need to unwind and unknot. 🤯
